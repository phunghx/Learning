\section{Introduction to Essays}
\subsection{What is an Essay?}
The essay has:Title, Introduction, Body paragraphs, Conclusion

Introduction: Thesis statement

Body paragraphs: support thesis with examples

Put a thesis statement at the end of the introduction

\subsection{Introduction paragraph} 
Using Hooks:
\begin{itemize}
\item{Attract attention}
\item{Create interest}
\item{Make the reader want to continue}
\end{itemize}
To have a hook, we can use:
\begin{itemize}
\item{Surprising Statement}
\item{Anecdote: short story that related to thesis}
\item{Question but not often}
\item{statistic but maybe boring for readers}
\end{itemize}

Organizing: Hook -> More specific statements -> Thesis statement (From general to specific idea)

Thesis statement = topic + controlling idea

Topic = subject/ thing
Controlling idea = what you want to say about it (for whom/ what purpose?)

Thing to avoid:
\begin{itemize}
\item{Don't announce your thesis: I will talk/ this essay will talk about ..}
\item{Don't write a fact, must argumentative}
\item{Don't write a popular opinion}
\item{Don't use pronouns}
\end{itemize}



\section{Body Paragraph}

Structure:

\begin{itemize}
\item{Topic Sentence}
\item{---Supporting idea 1}
\item{------detail and examples}
\item{---Supporting idea 2}
\item{------detail and examples}
\item{---Supporting idea 3}
\item{------detail and examples}
\item{Conclusion or Sentence Transition: same with topic sentence but different grammar or synonym}
\end{itemize}

Topic sentences = specific topic + controlling idea

--- Must support the thesis statement

--- Must have keywords/ or transition

--- Avoid pronouns

Coherence: Using transition word, join sentences, synonym of keywords
 
\section{Essay Conclusion}
How to end the essay
\begin{itemize}
\item{Summarize the major points}
\item{Restate the thesis}
\item{Leave a final thought}
\item{Don't sate new information}
\end{itemize}

Focus on the topic sentences

Other ways to end an Essay
\begin{itemize}
\item{Predict an outcome}
\item{Make a suggestion}
\item{Call for action}
\end{itemize}

\section{Writing Process}
Pre-writing: clustering and outline

Writing:rough Draft (it is very messy- write quickly)

Rewriting: revise Rough draft: looking the ideas, add more examples, remove some ideas not working

Edit: looking for mistakes: spelling, grammar
